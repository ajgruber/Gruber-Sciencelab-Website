  abstract = "The use of pegylated interferon-$\alpha$ (pegIFN-$\alpha$) has
              replaced unmodified recombinant IFN-$\alpha$ for the treatment of
              chronic viral hepatitis. While the superior antiviral efficacy of
              pegIFN-$\alpha$ is generally attributed to improved
              pharmacokinetic properties, the pharmacodynamic effects of
              pegIFN-$\alpha$ in the liver have not been studied. Here, we
              analyzed pegIFN-$\alpha$-induced signaling and gene regulation in
              paired liver biopsies obtained prior to treatment and during the
              first week following pegIFN-$\alpha$ injection in 18 patients
              with chronic hepatitis C. Despite sustained high concentrations
              of pegIFN-$\alpha$ in serum, the Jak/STAT pathway was activated
              in hepatocytes only on the first day after pegIFN-$\alpha$
              administration. Evaluation of liver biopsies revealed that
              pegIFN-$\alpha$ induces hundreds of genes that can be classified
              into four clusters based on different temporal expression
              profiles. In all clusters, gene transcription was mainly driven
              by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Compared with
              conventional IFN-$\alpha$ therapy, pegIFN-$\alpha$ induced a
              broader spectrum of gene expression, including many genes
              involved in cellular immunity. IFN-induced secondary
              transcription factors did not result in additional waves of gene
              expression. Our data indicate that the superior antiviral
              efficacy of pegIFN-$\alpha$ is not the result of prolonged
              Jak/STAT pathway activation in hepatocytes, but rather is due to
              induction of additional genes that are involved in cellular
              immune responses.",
