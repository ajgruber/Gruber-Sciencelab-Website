abstract: Mammalian gene expression is controlled at multiple levels by a variety of regulators, including chromatin modifiers, transcription factors and miRNAs. The latter are small, ncRNAs that inhibit the expression of target mRNAs by reducing both their stability and translation rate. In this review, we summarize the recent work towards characterizing miRNA targets that are themselves involved in the regulation of gene expression at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic regulators are strongly enriched among the predicted targets of miRNAs, which may contribute to the documented importance of miRNAs for pluripotency, organism development and somatic cell reprogramming.
