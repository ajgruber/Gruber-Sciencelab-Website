  abstract = "Sequencing of RNA 3' ends has uncovered numerous sites that do
              not correspond to the termination sites of known transcripts.
              Through their 3' untranslated regions, protein-coding RNAs
              interact with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, which regulate
              many properties, including RNA stability and subcellular
              localization. We developed the terminal exon characterization
              (TEC) tool ( http://tectool.unibas.ch ), which can be used with
              RNA-sequencing data from any species for which a genome
              annotation that includes sites of RNA cleavage and
              polyadenylation is available. We discovered hundreds of
              previously unknown isoforms and cell-type-specific terminal exons
              in human cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that many of
              these isoforms were translated. By applying TECtool to
              single-cell sequencing data, we found that the newly identified
              isoforms were expressed in subpopulations of cells. Thus, TECtool
              enables the identification of previously unknown isoforms in
              well-studied cell systems and in rare cell types.",
