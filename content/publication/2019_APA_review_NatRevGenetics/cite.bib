  abstract = "Most human genes have multiple sites at which RNA 3' end cleavage
              and polyadenylation can occur, enabling the expression of
              distinct transcript isoforms under different conditions. Novel
              methods to sequence RNA 3' ends have generated comprehensive
              catalogues of polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites; their analysis
              using innovative computational methods has revealed how poly(A)
              site choice is regulated by core RNA 3' end processing factors,
              such as cleavage factor I and cleavage and polyadenylation
              specificity factor, as well as by other RNA-binding proteins,
              particularly splicing factors. Here, we review the experimental
              and computational methods that have enabled the global mapping of
              mRNA and of long non-coding RNA 3' ends, quantification of the
              resulting isoforms and the discovery of regulators of alternative
              cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). We highlight the different
              types of APA-derived isoforms and their functional differences,
              and illustrate how APA contributes to human diseases, including
              cancer and haematological, immunological and neurological
              diseases.",
