  abstract = "The findings that microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for early
              development in many species and that embryonic miRNAs can
              reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
              suggest that these miRNAs act directly on transcriptional and
              chromatin regulators of pluripotency. To elucidate the
              transcription regulatory networks immediately downstream of
              embryonic miRNAs, we extended the motif activity response
              analysis approach that infers the regulatory impact of both
              transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs from genome-wide
              expression states. Applying this approach to multiple
              experimental data sets generated from mouse embryonic stem cells
              (ESCs) that did or did not express miRNAs of the ESC-specific
              miR-290-295 cluster, we identified multiple TFs that are direct
              miRNA targets, some of which are known to be active during cell
              differentiation. Our results provide new insights into the
              transcription regulatory network downstream of ESC-specific
              miRNAs, indicating that these miRNAs act on cell cycle and
              chromatin regulators at several levels and downregulate TFs that
              are involved in the innate immune response.",
