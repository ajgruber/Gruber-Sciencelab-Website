We are analysing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data with a main focus on endometrial and colorectal cancers. However, we also contribute to the Genomics England clinical interpretation partnerships (GeCIPs) for ovarian, testicular, renal and lung cancers. We aim to extend our understanding of these cancers and their molecular subtypes ultimately advancing precision medicine.
