  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The transition between epithelial and mesenchymal
              phenotypes (EMT) occurs in a variety of contexts. It is critical
              for mammalian development and it is also involved in tumor
              initiation and progression. Master transcription factor (TF)
              regulators of this process are conserved between mouse and human.
              METHODS: From a computational analysis of a variety of
              high-throughput sequencing data sets we initially inferred that
              TFAP2A is connected to the core EMT network in both species. We
              then analysed publicly available human breast cancer data for
              TFAP2A expression and also studied the expression (by mRNA
              sequencing), activity (by monitoring the expression of its
              predicted targets), and binding (by electrophoretic mobility
              shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation) of this factor in
              a mouse mammary gland EMT model system (NMuMG) cell line.
              RESULTS: We found that upon induction of EMT, the activity of
              TFAP2A, reflected in the expression level of its predicted
              targets, is up-regulated in a variety of systems, both murine and
              human, while TFAP2A's expression is increased in more
              ``stem-like'' cancers. We provide strong evidence for the direct
              interaction between the TFAP2A TF and the ZEB2 promoter and we
              demonstrate that this interaction affects ZEB2 expression.
              Overexpression of TFAP2A from an exogenous construct perturbs
              EMT, however, in a manner similar to the downregulation of
              endogenous TFAP2A that takes place during EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              study reveals that TFAP2A is a conserved component of the core
              network that regulates EMT, acting as a repressor of many genes,
              including ZEB2. REVIEWERS: This article has been reviewed by Dr.
