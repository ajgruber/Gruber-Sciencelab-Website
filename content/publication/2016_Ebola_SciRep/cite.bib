  abstract = "The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa resulted in
              over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, underlining the need for a
              better understanding of the biology of this highly pathogenic
              virus to develop specific counter strategies. Two filoviruses,
              the Ebola and Marburg viruses, result in a severe and often fatal
              infection in humans. However, bats are natural hosts and survive
              filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. The molecular
              basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus
              infections is not well understood. We report a systematic
              overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and
              pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and
              Marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of
              filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We
              also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus
              infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We
              observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several
              genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of
              PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death. We
              used comparative transcriptomics to provide a data resource that
              can be used to identify cellular responses that might allow bats
              to survive filovirus infections.",
