  abstract = "Mammalian gene expression is controlled at multiple levels by a
              variety of regulators, including chromatin modifiers,
              transcription factors and miRNAs. The latter are small, ncRNAs
              that inhibit the expression of target mRNAs by reducing both
              their stability and translation rate. In this review, we
              summarize the recent work towards characterizing miRNA targets
              that are themselves involved in the regulation of gene expression
              at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic regulators are strongly
              enriched among the predicted targets of miRNAs, which may
              contribute to the documented importance of miRNAs for
              pluripotency, organism development and somatic cell
              reprogramming.",
