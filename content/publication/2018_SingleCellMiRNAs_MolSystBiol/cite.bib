  abstract = "miRNAs are small RNAs that regulate gene expression
              post-transcriptionally. By repressing the translation and
              promoting the degradation of target mRNAs, miRNAs may reduce the
              cell-to-cell variability in protein expression, induce
              correlations between target expression levels, and provide a
              layer through which targets can influence each other's expression
              as ``competing RNAs'' (ceRNAs). However, experimental evidence
              for these behaviors is limited. Combining mathematical modeling
              with RNA sequencing of individual human embryonic kidney cells in
              which the expression of two distinct miRNAs was induced over a
              wide range, we have inferred parameters describing the response
              of hundreds of miRNA targets to miRNA induction. Individual
              targets have widely different response dynamics, and only a small
              proportion of predicted targets exhibit high sensitivity to miRNA
              induction. Our data reveal for the first time the response
              parameters of the entire network of endogenous miRNA targets to
              miRNA induction, demonstrating that miRNAs correlate target
              expression and at the same time increase the variability in
              expression of individual targets across cells. The approach is
              generalizable to other miRNAs and post-transcriptional regulators
              to improve the understanding of gene expression dynamics in
              individual cell types.",
