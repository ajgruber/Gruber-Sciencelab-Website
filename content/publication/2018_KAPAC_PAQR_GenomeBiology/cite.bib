  abstract = "3' Untranslated regions (3' UTRs) length is regulated in relation
              to cellular state. To uncover key regulators of poly(A) site use
              in specific conditions, we have developed PAQR, a method for
              quantifying poly(A) site use from RNA sequencing data and KAPAC,
              an approach that infers activities of oligomeric sequence motifs
              on poly(A) site choice. Application of PAQR and KAPAC to RNA
              sequencing data from normal and tumor tissue samples uncovers
              motifs that can explain changes in cleavage and polyadenylation
              in specific cancers. In particular, our analysis points to
              polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 as a regulator of poly(A)
              site choice in glioblastoma.",
