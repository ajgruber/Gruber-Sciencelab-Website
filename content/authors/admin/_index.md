I have a PhD in Bioinformatics and an undergraduate background in both, software development and biotechnology. In recent years, I have authored a number of machine learning-based data science tools, webservices and databases. Currently, we are contributing to the Pan Prostate Cancer Group. Also, we work within multiple clinical interpretation partnerships (GeCIPs) of the UKs 100'000 genomes project, with a particular interest in endometrial and colorectal cancers. 
#Inferring mutational signatures from whole genome / exome sequencing data and relating them to other molecular features, such as copy number and structural variations, enables a fine grained molecular stratification into cancer subtypes and advances our understanding of the molecular processes that shape individual tumours.
