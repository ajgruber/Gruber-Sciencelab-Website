  abstract  = "Alternative polyadenylation is a cellular mechanism that
               generates mRNA isoforms differing in their 3′ untranslated
               regions (3′ UTRs). Changes in polyadenylation site usage have
               been described upon induction of proliferation in resting cells,
               but the underlying mechanism and functional significance of this
               phenomenon remain largely unknown. To understand the functional
               consequences of shortened 3′ UTR isoforms in a physiological
               setting, we used 3′ end sequencing and quantitative mass
               spectrometry to determine polyadenylation site usage, mRNA and
               protein levels in murine and human naive and activated T cells.
               Although 3′ UTR shortening in proliferating cells is conserved
               between human and mouse, orthologous genes do not exhibit
               similar expression of alternative 3′ UTR isoforms. We generally
               find that 3′ UTR shortening is not accompanied by a
               corresponding change in mRNA and protein levels. This suggests
               that although 3′ UTR shortening may lead to changes in the
               RNA-binding protein interactome, it has limited effects on
               protein output.",
