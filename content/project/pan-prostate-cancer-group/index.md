The “PAN PROSTATE CANCER GROUP” (PPCG) harmonises and interrogates whole genome sequencing (WGS) data generated around the world from over 2000 men with prostate cancer, including a broad range of clinical categories, and ethnicities. Further, the dataset encompasses transcriptome and methylome data. The overarching aim of PPCG is to provide breakthrough advances through analysis of a very large series of prostate cancer data contributed by many of the leading scientists and clinicians.
Currently, we are contributing to the working groups for prostate cancer (i) transcriptomics, (ii) mutational processes, and (iii) evolution. Further, we are part of the PPCG technical working group.
